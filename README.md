            The influenza virus is a highly contagious pathogen that causes respiratory illness in humans and animals. 
            It is characterized by its rapid mutation and ability to evade immune responses, leading to seasonal outbreaks 
            and occasional pandemics. The virus is classified into types A, B, C, and D, with type A being the most common 
            cause of severe illness.

            Influenza spreads through respiratory droplets and can cause symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, 
            muscle aches, and fatigue. Vaccination and antiviral medications are key strategies for prevention and treatment.
